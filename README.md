# Clinic Management System

This project aims to analyze the Albanian healthcare system and its welfare structure, identifying potential improvements based on the current organizational framework. Given the challenges of paper-based medical records and long patient wait times, we propose the development of a web-based application to digitize operations within public hospitals in our country.

### Key Features of the Project

- **Online Appointment Booking**: Patients can schedule appointments through the system, minimizing the need for in-person visits to arrange consultations.

- **Digital Medical Records**: Each patient's medical history will be stored electronically, facilitating easier access and management.

- **Medical Staff Schedules**: The application will display the timetables of healthcare professionals, improving appointment management.

- **Doctor's Agenda**: Each physician will have a dedicated agenda for managing their appointments and patient interactions.

- **Prescription Management**: The system will enable the creation and sharing of electronic prescriptions.

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation will involve close collaboration with polyclinics to ensure that the system meets the needs of both healthcare providers and patients. Each patient will have a personal account within the system, allowing them to manage their appointments according to doctors' availability. After consultations, physicians can update patient records, which will then be available for download by patients.

Each doctor will have their own account where they can:
- Add new patients
- Schedule appointments
- Document notes from consultations that are integrated into patient records
- Review existing medical histories

Receptionists will have access to all profiles and can edit personal information, but they are restricted from using this information for any unauthorized purposes.

This comprehensive approach aims to streamline operations within the healthcare sector, ultimately leading to enhanced patient care and improved operational efficiency.
